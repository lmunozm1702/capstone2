# 📖 JavaScript Capstone - API-based webapp

> This JavaScript capstone project is built on [iTunes Search API](https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api), an external API which is used to get the data of different ebooks, and an [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) which is used to record the user interactions including likes and comments.
